# Todo

- Make people confirm before deleting an applicant
  - It's easy to accidentally delete an applicant from the applicant list
  - This would cause problems, especially if users have already voted on them
- Implement the gender ratio rule
  - Right now, you just get a list of applicants sorted by score
  - You have to figure out the gender ratio manually
  - There could be a few different ways to do this
- Make the client side update automatically when the admin changes the current person
